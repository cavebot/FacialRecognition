# FacialRecognition
C++ Code that uses the OpenCV2 pre-trained Haar-cascade classifier to detect faces in a frame, in this case a webcam stream(or input video file).
OpenCV2 library must be compiled and link for it to run but will run once this is done.

Version 2 upcoming: GPU acceleration for classificiation. Current framerate is not great. OpenCV library available for GPU parallelization.
Version 3... Add automatic face pixelation option.
